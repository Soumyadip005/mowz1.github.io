              <p class="card-text">Hi customer, today I would like to explain about the harms of cooking oil after maximum usage. Most people say oil foods are bad for health but it’s not true. Proper consumption of oil is actually good for health. this cooking oil contains unsaturated fatty acids, antioxidants and other compounds that may offer health benefits. The main issue about the reusing cooking oil is it increase free radicals in the body, which cause inflammation and reusing of cooking oil is the cause of the most diseases including obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Because of this kind of diseases, it causes high inflam-mation in the body, also reduce immunity and reduce the life span of people.
                Customer is the back bone of all the business hence if we owner neglect the customer health for profit in short term it may be profitable but in the long run it definitely causes lot of health issues for the customer so it creates bad reputation. according to FSSAI (Food Safety and Standard Authority of India) guidelines say the re heating should be avoided and in case you have to reuse oil, maximum of three times is permitted to avoid formation of trans-fat.
              </p>

              <h3 class="p-3 mb-2 bg-light text-black">DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO EDIBLE OIL WHEN IT IS REHEATED?</h3>
              <p class="card-text">Every time cooking oil is heated up to a temperature of 170°C - 220°C. So, each time the oil is reheated it undergoes chemical changes and produces harmful toxic compounds that are known to cause serious health effects. studies have shown that reusing of cooking oil can cause considerable damages to vital body organs. So don’t overdo it and try to reduce the reheating process as much as possible and be aware of its danger.
              </p>

              <h3 class="p-3 mb-2 bg-light text-black">WHAT CAN WE DO TO REDUCE THE REHEATING PROCESS OF COOKING OIL IN 2022?</h3>
              <img class="card-img-top" src="assets/img/Blog/flow1.jpeg" alt="Card image cap">
              <p class="card-text">Now a day there is an easy method to make the maximum used oil into quick cash. It is a simple pro-cess just you need to make a contract with RUCO company (repurpose used cooking oil). They col-lect this maximum used oil for good price so you no need to worry about it will be converted into green diesel and it will not be harmful to the environment. So as an owner of a business the unsuitable cooking oil will be converted into profit for you and health of your customer is going to be in good shape. This is a profit situation for you.

              <p class="card-text">Hi everyone today I would like to talk about the usefulness of credit card and its benefits. In our day-to-day life credit card has become the most indispensable part of our lives, because it is easy to use and payback conveniently. However, there is a problem for credit card users that is it become debt traps if not used correctly, or spend more than you can repay when the bill comes around. But business is all about risk and return. If you hesitate to take a risk in a right time you will not become a first-class business man. Cash back play an important role in the popularity of the credit card and reward points help to use the earn points on every purchase that you make using your credit card, after accumulating a certain number of reward points you can redeem them for a variety of options such as vouchers, gift items and in some special case flight ticket. Finally, the most important benefit is compared to the debit card credit card is much safety to use. In the debit card there is simple process such as swiping and enter unique pin, if any third party know about your unique pin and obtain your debit cart it is possible to steal your cash but in the credit card it is impossible to steal your cash because only purchase can be done by it. The safety measure can be done by process of limit setting on your credit card to reduce over using it and in transactions there are swiping, authorization, approval, processing, credit card charges, merchant payment, and billing. So, every process helps to improve its safety. So, a business owner, credit card payment makes it payment convenient for your customers to pay for goods and services which helps to increase your profitability in business.

            <p class="card-text">Purified water is water that has been filtered or processed to remove impurities like chemicals and other contaminants. It is usually produced using groundwater or tap water. Through purification, many types of impurities are removed, including
                  • Bacteria
                  • Algae
                  • Fungi
                  • Parasites
                  • Metals like copper and lead
                  • Chemical pollutants.

                  Water purification removes contaminants that may remain in drinking water and improves water quality and taste. Tap water is purified to make it safe for human consumption. The “alkaline” in alkaline water refers to its pH level. The pH level is a number that measures how acidic or alkaline a substance is on a scale of 0 to 14. For example, something with a pH of 1 would be very acidic and something with a pH of 13 would be very alkaline. Alkaline water has a higher pH level than regular drinking water. Because of this, some advocates of alkaline water believe it can neutralize the acid in your body. 
                  Normal drinking water generally has a neutral pH of 7. Alkaline water typically has a pH of 8 or 9.
                  However, pH alone isn’t enough to impart substantial alkalinity to water.
                  Alkaline water must also contain alkaline minerals and negative oxidation reduction potential (ORP). ORP is the ability of water to act as a pro or antioxidant. The more negative the ORP value, the more antioxidizing it is.
                  Those who consumed high
                  pH water reduced viscosity by 6.3 percent compared to 3.36 percent
                  with standard purified d rinking water. This means blood flowed more efficiently with alkaline
                  water. This can increase oxygen delivery throughout out the body.
                  proponents of alkaline water still believe in its proposed health benefits. <br>
                  These include:
                  • anti aging properties (via liquid antioxidants that absorb more quickly into the human body)
                  • colon cleansing properties
                  • immune system support
                  • hydration, skin health, and other detoxifying properties
                  • weight loss
                  • cancer resistance. <br>

                  They also argue that soft drinks, which are notoriously acidic, have very positive ORPs leading to many health problems, while properly ionized and alkalinized waters have highly negative ORPs. Green tea is rich in antioxidants and has a slightly negative ORP. Water that’s naturally alkaline occurs when water passes over rocks like springs and picks up minerals, which increase its alkaline level.
                  <br>
                  However, many people who drink alkaline water buy alkaline water that’s been through a chemical process called electrolysis. This technique uses a product called an ionizer to raise the pH of regular water. Makers of ionizers say that electricity is used to separate molecules in the water that are more acidic or more alkaline. The acidic water is then funneled out. Still, some doctors and researchers say these claims aren’t backed by quality research. The water quality of the original source, before ionization, is crucial to ensuring contaminants aren’t present in the drinking water. Some scientists advise using reverse osmosis to adequately purify w ater before connecting an alkaline ionizer, which can raise pH and add minerals. A study published by the WHO cautions against drinking water with low mineral content, which is created by reverse osmosis, distillation, and other methods (without additional mineralization) on a regular basis.
